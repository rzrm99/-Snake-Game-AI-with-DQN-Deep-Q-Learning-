# Snake Game AI with DQN (Deep Q-Learning)

This project is an implementation of a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to play a custom version of the Snake game.

## Features

- ✅ Multiple food types: normal, gold, and green — each with different reward values.
- ✅ Dynamic difficulty: more obstacles added every 25 episodes.
- ✅ Visual rendering using Pygame (optional).
- ✅ DQN Agent with experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and target network updates.
- ✅ Matplotlib plot to visualize training progress.
